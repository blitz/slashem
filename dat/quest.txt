%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
appear to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It looks
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00006
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00007
"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00008
"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00009
"So you're %ls prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00010
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E
%Cp Arc 00011
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00012
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00013
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00014
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"%p!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Arc 00016
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must the defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Arc 00020
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00021
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00022
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00023
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00024
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E
%Cp Arc 00025
"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cp Arc 00030
You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00031
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00040
You sense the presence of %o.
%E
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the astral plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."
%E

#       Barbarian

%Cc Bar 00001
Warily you scan your surroundings, all of your senses alert for signs
of possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can see the familiar shapes
of %H.

But why, you think, should %l be there?

Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
evil magic in the air.

Without thought, you ready your weapon, and mutter under your breath:

    "By %d, there will be blood spilt today."
%E
%Cp Bar 00002
Once again, you near %H.  You know that %l
will be waiting.
%E
%Cp Bar 00003
Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
%H.
%E
%Cp Bar 00005
"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00006
"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00007
"There has been little treasure to loot, since the horde arrived."
%E
%Cp Bar 00008
"The horde is mighty in numbers, but they have little courage."
%E
%Cp Bar 00009
"%lC is a strange one, but he has helped defend us."
%E
%Cc Bar 00010
"Ah, %p.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
need of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.

"But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."
%E
%Cp Bar 00011
"%p, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00012
"Again, you stand before me, %p.  Surely you have prepared yourself."
%E
%Cc Bar 00013
"Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, %p.  You will never attain
the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
closed this future to you.

"I will protect these people as best I can, but soon %n will overcome
me and destroy all who once called you %s.  Now begone!"
%E
%Cc Bar 00014
"%p, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
%n.  Only %Ra with the help of %d could ever hope to
defeat him."
%E
%Cp Bar 00015
"%p!  You have wandered from the path of the %a!
If you attempt to overcome %n in this state, he will surely
enslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
Go forth, and return when you feel ready."
%E
%Cc Bar 00016
"The world is in great need of your assistance, %p.

"About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
as %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
about him.

"At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
potent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan.

"%nC and his Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated
the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken
%o, and seeks to bend it to his will.  I detected the
subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people.
Then I sent forth a summons for you.

"If %n can bend %o to his will, he will become
almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
and with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n.

"You must go to %i.  From there, you can track down
%n, defeat him, and return %o to us.  Only
then will the world be safe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00020
"%nC is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
%E
%Cp Bar 00021
"Remember that %n is a great sorcerer.  He lived in the time
of Atlantis."
%E
%Cp Bar 00022
"If you fail, %p, I will not be able to protect these people long."
%E
%Cp Bar 00023
"To enter %i, you must be very stealthy.  The horde will be on
guard."
%E
%Cp Bar 00024
"Call upon %d in your time of need."
%E
%Cp Bar 00025
"May %d protect you, and guide your steps."
%E
%Cp Bar 00026
"If you can lay hands upon %o, carry it for good fortune."
%E
%Cp Bar 00027
"I cannot stand against %ns sorcery.  But %d will help you."
%E
%Cp Bar 00028
"Do not fear %n.  I know you can defeat him."
%E
%Cp Bar 00029
"You have a great road to travel, %p, but only after you defeat
%n."
%E
%Cc Bar 00030
The scent of water comes to you in the desert breeze.  You know that
you have located %i.
%E
%Cp Bar 00031
Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate %i.
%E
%Cc Bar 00040
The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
very air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
make you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of %n.
%E
%Cp Bar 00041
Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.
%E
%Cc Bar 00050
"So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer %l sends to do his bidding.
I have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.

"Prepare to die, %c."
%E
%Cp Bar 00051
"I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00052
"You return yet again, %c!  Are you prepared for death now?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00053
"I shall have %o back, you pitiful excuse for %ca.
And your life as well."
%E
%Cp Bar 00060
"My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00061
"You are a sorry excuse for %ra."
%E
%Cp Bar 00062
"Run while you can, %c.  My next spell will be your last."
%E
%Cp Bar 00063
"I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
%E
%Cp Bar 00064
"%d cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00065
"Your %a nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Bar 00066
"Come, %c.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00067
"Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off %l, and your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00068
"Fight, %c, or are you afraid of the mighty %n?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00069
"You have failed, %c.  Now, my victory is complete."
%E
%Cc Bar 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel the power of it
flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
at once, even though you are holding it.
%E
%Cp Bar 00080
%nC falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then his
body fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
slowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
begun to fade.
%E
%Cc Bar 00081
When %l sees %o, he smiles, and says:

    Well done, %p.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
    What, now, should be done with %o?

    These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
    other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as %n did.

    Take %o with you, %p.  It will guard you in
    your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
    quest far greater than you realize.

    Remember me, %p, and return when you have triumphed.  I
    will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
    time comes.
%E
%Cp Bar 00090
"Tell us, %p, have you fared well on your great quest?"
%E
%Cc Bar 00091
"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly
succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will
    stand by %d as champion of all %Cp Flaor eternity.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."
%E

#       Cave(wo)man

%Cc Cav 00001
You descend through a barely familiar stairwell that you remember
%l showing you when you embarked upon your vision quest.

You arrive back at %H, but something seems
wrong here.  The usual smoke and glowing light of the fires of the
outer caves are absent, and an uneasy quiet fills the damp air.
%E
%Cp Cav 00002
Once again, you arrive back at %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00003
For some reason, you think that this may be the last time you will
enter %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00005
"We have not been able to gather as much food since the Giants sealed
off our access to the outer world."
%E
%Cp Cav 00006
"Since %n sent her minions, we have been constantly fighting."
%E
%Cp Cav 00007
"I have heard your vision quest was successful.  Is this so?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00008
"So, tell me, %p, how have you fared?"
%E
%Cp Cav 00009
"%lC grows old.  We know not who will guide us after he ascends."
%E
%Cc Cav 00010
"You have returned from your vision quest, %p.  Thank %d.

"We are in dire need of your help, my %S.

"But first, I must see if you are yet capable of the quest I would
ask you to undertake."
%E
%Cp Cav 00011
"Again, you return to us, %p.  Let me see if you are ready now."
%E
%Cp Cav 00012
"Ah, %p.  Are you finally ready?"
%E
%Cc Cav 00013
"%p!  You have sealed our fate.  You seem unable to reform yourself,
so I must select another to take your place.

"Begone from %H!  You have betrayed us by choosing
the path of the %C over the true path of the %L.

"You no longer live in our eyes."
%E
%Cc Cav 00014
"Alas, %p, you are as yet too inexperienced to embark upon such
a difficult quest as that I propose to give you.

"%rA could not possibly survive the rigors demanded to find
%i, never mind to confront %n herself.

"Adventure some more, and you will learn the skills you will require.
%d decrees it."
%E
%Cc Cav 00015
"%p!  You have deviated from my teachings.  You no longer follow
the path of the %a as you should.  I banish you from these caves, to
go forth and purify yourself.  Then, you might be able to accomplish this
quest."
%E
%Cc Cav 00016
"You are indeed ready now, %p.  I shall tell you a tale of
great suffering among your people:

"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by
the creatures sent against us by %n.

"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
minions of %n managed to steal %o.
They took it to %i and there, none of our
%g warriors have been able to go.

"You must find %i, and within it wrest
%o from %n.  She guards it as
jealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
we can make our caves safe once more.

"Please, %p, recover %o for us, and return it here."
%E
%Cp Cav 00020
"%nC is immune to her own breath weapons.
You should use magic upon her that she does not use herself."
%E
%Cp Cav 00021
"When you encounter %n, call upon %d for assistance."
%E
%Cp Cav 00022
"There will be nowhere to hide inside the %ns inner sanctum."
%E
%Cp Cav 00023
"Your best chance with %n will be to keep moving."
%E
%Cp Cav 00024
"Do not be distracted by the great treasures in the %ns lair.
Concentrate on %o."
%E
%Cp Cav 00025
"%oC is the only object that %n truly fears."
%E
%Cp Cav 00026
"Do not be fooled by the %ns size.  She is fast, and it is
rumored that she uses magic."
%E
%Cp Cav 00027
"I would send a party of %gP with you, but we will need all
of our strength to defend ourselves."
%E
%Cp Cav 00028
"Remember, be %a at all times.  This is your strength."
%E
%Cp Cav 00029
"If only we had an amulet of reflection, this would not have happened."
%E
%Cc Cav 00030
You %x many large claw marks on the ground.  The tunnels ahead
of you are larger than most of those in any cave complex you have
ever been in before.

Your nose detects the smell of carrion from within, and bones litter
the sides of the tunnels.
%E
%Cp Cav 00031
Once again, you approach %i.
%E
%Cc Cav 00040
You find yourself in a large cavern, with neatly polished walls, that
nevertheless show signs of being scorched by fire.

Bones litter the floor, and there are objects scattered everywhere.
The air is close with the stench of sulphurous fumes.

%nC is clearly visible, but she seems to be asleep.
%E
%Cp Cav 00041
Once again, you find yourself in the lair of %n.
%E
%Cc Cav 00050
"So, human, you seek to invade the lair of %n.
Only my meals are allowed down here.  Prepare to be eaten!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00051
"So, again you face me, %c.  No human has ever before escaped me.
Now I shall kill you."
%E
%Cp Cav 00052
"You are getting annoying, %c.  Prepare to die."
%E
%Cp Cav 00053
"I'll have %o from you, %c.  You shall die."
%E
%Cp Cav 00060
"You are weak, %c.  No challenge for the Mother of all Dragons."
%E
%Cp Cav 00061
"I grow hungry, human.  You look like a nice appetizer!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00062
"Join me for lunch?  You're the main course, %c."
%E
%Cp Cav 00063
"With %o, I am invincible!  You cannot succeed."
%E
%Cp Cav 00064
"Your mentor, %l has failed.  You are nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Cav 00065
"You shall die here, %c.  %rA cannot hope to defeat me."
%E
%Cp Cav 00066
"You, a mere %r challenge the might of %n?  Hah!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00067
"I am the Mother of all Dragons!  You cannot hope to defeat me."
%E
%Cp Cav 00068
"My claws are sharp now.  I shall rip you to shreds!"
%E
%Cp Cav 00069
"%d has deserted you, %c.  This is my domain."
%E
%Cc Cav 00070
As you pick up %o it seems heavy at first, but as you
hold it strength flows into your arms.

You suddenly feel full of power, as if nothing could possibly stand
in your path.
%E
%Cp Cav 00080
%nC sinks to the ground, her heads flailing about.
As she dies, a cloud of noxious fumes billows about her.
%E
%Cc Cav 00081
%lC glimpses %o in your possession.
He smiles and says:

    You have done it!  We are saved.  But I fear that %o
    will always be a target for %C forces who will want it for their
    own.

    To prevent further trouble, I would like you, %p,
    to take %o away with you.  It will help you as you
    quest for the Amulet of Yendor.
%E
%Cp Cav 00090
"%p!  Welcome back.
How goes your quest to recover the Amulet for %d?"
%E
%Cc Cav 00091
"You have been successful, I see, %p.

"Now that the Amulet of Yendor is yours, here is what you must do:

"Journey upwards to the open air.  The Amulet you carry will then
take you into the Astral Planes, where the Great Temple of %d
casts its influence throughout our world.

"Sacrifice the Amulet on the altar.  Thus shall %d become supreme!"

%Cc Dop 00001
You find yourself standing in sight of %H.  Something
is obviously wrong here.  The %H is badly damaged, walls
have been blasted apart and torn.

You realize that the %l needs your assistance!

A great blow has befallen our order; perhaps you can help us.
First, however, I must determine if you are prepared for this

"You have been corrupted, %p!  How can you, %ra, deviate so from the

%sa to this order.  We will try our best without you, as you have 
failed us utterly."
%E
%Cc Dop 00014
"Alas, %p, it is not yet to be.  A mere %r could never

when you have attained the rank of %R."
%E
%Cc Dop 00015
"This is terrible, %p.  You have deviated from the way of balance!
You know that %d requires that we be impartial in the world around

you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Dop 00016
"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  I shall endevor to tell you
what has occurred while you were away."

"A short time ago we were beseiged by the Transmuter, a wizard  
of great power. We though nothing of it as we were well defended
and he would be no match for us because of our ability."

"However through the use of great magic he opened a portal into 
the room containing the %H and stole it.  With its power
he could easily see through our transformations.  He then summoned many 
chameleons, and we can not transform in fear of destroying members of 
our own clan. 

"We need you to find %i, and then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
creatures that roam the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."

You have entered a cave that seems to have been drastically altered by magic.
There is smoke and fumes all around, yet the air seems moist and damp.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by

%E
%Cp Dop 00031
Again, you stand before %i.

The black fumes and heat wash over you as you decend into this dark

Again, you have invaded %ns domain.

%Cc Dop 00050
"Ah, so %l has sent another %g to retrieve

"I shall have you turned into a newt for my pleasure!"
%E

"Despair now, %r.  %d cannot help you."
%E

"I shall feast upon your soul for many days, %c."

"Your death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!"

"You cannot defeat %n, you fool.  I shall kill you now."

"I feel your powers failing you, %r.  You shall die now."
%E
%Cp Dop 00069
"With %o, nothing can stand in my way."
%E
%Cc Dop 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel as though a great
weight has been lifted from your shoulders. You understand 
why %n stole it from %H, for with it, 
%ca of %d could easily defeat his plans.

You sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
get the impression that you must return to %l as soon
as possible.
%E
%Cc Dop 00080
You hear %n gasp one last breath and collapse to the ground.

Suddenly, you hear a voice in the back of your mind,

    How could you have defeated me? I was so much 
    more powerful, I had %o and legions of   
    creatures at my command. You are certainly a force
    to be reckoned with ... I pity the Wizard of Yendor.

Then the voice of %n fades away, never to be heard again.
%E
%Cc Dop 00081
"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
Congratulations.

"I have been awaiting you return and have been thinking.  You

the world and serve %d.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."

%Cp Dop 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"

"You have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,
you must take the amulet, and sacrifice it on %ds altar on
the Astral plane.  I suspect that I shall never see you again in this

You find yourself on the familiar bank of the Long Lake, with the
buildings of Esgaroth visible nearby. %HC archers keep away
those monsters that manage to cross the water, but unfortunately the lands
outside are not so safe. Wolves howl on the wind! 

You steel yourself, and resolve to hurriedly cross the water and find out 
why you were summoned, and why %l is here, instead of in the Dwarven 
mines of Ered Luin?
%E
%Cp Dwa 00002
Once again you stand on the shores of the Long Lake.
%E
%Cp Dwa 00003
Yet again you stand on the shores of the Long Lake. Occasionally, you
notice red flashes to the north.
%E
%Cp Dwa 00005
"Avenge our forefathers for us, %p!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00006
"The King under the Mountain shall return and the rivers run with gold!"

"If you can do this, %p...perhaps? The Mansions of Khazad-Dum await.."
%E

"They say the wealth of the dragon is beyond counting."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00009
"The Blue are rich in iron, but my heart yearns for gold.."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00010
You instantly recognise %l from when you last saw him in the mines 
of Ered Luin. His descendancy from Durin the Deathless, and more recently 
Thror, King under the Mountain, is obvious. He bears himself with pride 
and hauteur, and his long, flowing beard is shock-white.

He stands, and visible at his side beneath the sky-blue hooded cloak is a 
sword, seemingly Elven in design, that looks to have a mighty lineage.

Pushing back his hood, he gives you a slow stare before speaking.

"The Wild can be a dangerous place to travel alone in these dark days, yet 
I see you have come far. But first I must ascertain how far..."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00011
"Ah, %p, you have returned.. Tell me of your more recent adventures.
What have you learnt? Have you grown more experienced in fighting?"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00012
"So, %p, again you stand before me. In the Wild the wargs and goblins
grow ever more restless, and %n stirs in the north. I know not how
much longer we can last. Are you yet ready?"
%E
%Cc Dwa 00013
"%p! You have failed? A thousand curses on you and yours! If you have
woken the Dragon but not killed him, we are surely doomed to perish in
dragon fire!

I would have you killed now, but you deserve not even that. Begone! And
if fortune looks kindly on you, know that no Dwarf will."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00014
"Ah, %p, it is foolish in the extreme to underestimate a dragon, and 
I cannot be sure you would succede. Go ye back into the Wild and hew ye 
some more orcs, and return when you are a %R."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00015
"Ah, alas, %p. The creatures of Morgoth have corrupted you in your
fight.

Dragons are cunning and intelligent, and any not pure of spirit will
surely be enslaved by their spells. I will heed the lesson of the Narn I
Hin Hurin, and send you not thither now.

Go back out, and return when you are better prepared."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00016
Yes, for better or ill, I deem you are ready. As you know, some 170 
years ago the accursed dragon %n descended on my grandfather's Kingdom 
in Erebor, killing many of my kin and driving us from our halls. I was 
there, although fortunately outside at the time..

This defeat weighs heavily on us, %p. I tell you there is no 
small store of gold in that mountain, and also %o, Heart of 
the Mountain. A more wondrous gem has not been seen since the first Age, 
and never in this part of the world.

I long to take up arms myself and attempt to defeat the dragon, yet I am 
nearing my 200th year, and I fear my skills are not as they were. I ask 
you, %p, to take up this quest for me. Succede in this, and your 
reward shall be what of the treasure you can carry out yourself!

Go, %p, and return victorious!

%Cc Dwa 00030
You have followed the River Running to its source at the Front
Gate. Here is the entrance to %i.To the east
you can just make out the ruins of Dale.

Steam drifts out the gateway, and in some places the water bubbles...The 
Dragon is obviously in.

The wind howls through the tree--wind? The Wargs are come! And orcs with 
them! The goblins from the mountains must have got wind of something..
%E
%Cp Dwa 00031
Once again you stand at the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Dwa 00040
As you near the Great Hall of Thrain, the dragon-stench increases to
almost unbearable levels. Only the reknowned stamina and willpower of the
dwarves allows you to continue. Occasionally, you hear a near-by rumble or
hissing sound as %n exhales.
%E
%Cp Dwa 00041
The mountain rumbles with the dragon's fury. %n was not pleased with 
your escape, and won't want to let you go this time..
%E
%Cc Dwa 00050
"Well, %p, good of you to come..I haven't tasted Dwarf in a while.

"Intelligence is a survival trait. It'll be a favour to weed you out.."

"I'll have the %o back before long. You're not leaving with it, I

%Cp Dwa 00060
"So they gave up on burglars? A pity, I liked the taste of hobbit."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00061
"Go back to your mines, long-beard, before I roast you!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00062
"You fight well for a dwarf, but no mortal ever defeated a dragon!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00063
"Your best could not kill me when I came, and I am grown now far stronger!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00064
"That is a fine weapon you have - it shall look well in my collection!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00065
"Your prancing amuses me. I may even let you live.."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00066
"You have courage, Dwarf. Fortunately, you will still taste good."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00067
"You act as if you had a chance.. But 'tis true, only a fool would have come."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00068
"A curse on the armour of Dwarves.. I fear I shall need a tin-opener."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00069
"You show some small skill.. but can you stand the heat?"
%E
%Cc Dwa 00070
%oC shines as you pick it up, it's white light red through your
skin. And you feel it could perhaps do more, if you knew how to unlock
its secrets..

It is clear now why %l valued the jewel so highly. You resolve to 
return it to him, even though it is rightfully yours as bounty.
%E
%Cc Dwa 00080
As you deal a final blow to %n's battered body, the dragon rears its 
head up into the air on its last strength, and cries out:

"No! I cannot believe it!" He swings his head around to stare at you 
again - "YOU? It can't be!"

With that, the mighty dragon crashes to the floor. You make your way 
around to his head, carefully avoiding the blood already etching 
interesting patterns into the stone floor, and deliver a mighty blow to 
the neck. The whole body jerks and you leap backwards out of the way in 
time to hear a hiss of breath escape from between the teeth. Never trust a 
dragon, you smile to yourself. It must surely be dead now, with a large 
gash in its neck, but to be sure you deliver a few more blows and take 
the head off completely. Only then do you turn to examine the hoard.
%E
%Cc Dwa 00081
"%p! Rumours have been rife that the %n has fallen, and I see it 
must be so! We will reoccupy the Mountain forthwith..

You have the %o? Ah, but it does good to see this.. Yet last 
night Aule appeared to be in a dream - it seems the %o is to be 
taken by you on your quest. It will be a victory in itself when its light 
shines out in Moloch's lair! 

I would that you had 50 of our best to aid you, but we will need them all 
in days to come, I fear. So you must make do with my blessing.

May your beard grow longer and your axe never dull."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00090
"Ah, %p! How goes your quest for the Amulet?"
%E
%Cc Dwa 00091
"The Amulet of Yendor.." %l raises the profferred amulet and looks 
at it, before handing it back. "Yes, I can see why Moloch would want it, 
and why Aule would send you to retrieve it for us.. but your quest is not 
yet over, %p.

Hence must you journey to the dungeon entrance and out, and with the 
Amulet you will be sent by the Gods into the Elemental Planes, areas of 
great danger and strangeness. The Amulet itself may help you find your 
way through them.

Survive this and you will find yourself in the Astral Plane. You must go 
to the temple of %d and offer up the Amulet. Good luck."

"A short time ago, the Uruk-hai tribes of the mountains to the east
invaded and enslaved the goblin tribes in this area.  The local
%nt is now only a figurehead, and serves the Uruk-hai Overlord.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
orcs and goblins, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
headed by %n himself, managed to breach the circle and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
underground castle of %n.  He has always coveted
%o, and will surely keep it on his person,
until he delivers it to the Uruk-hai Overlord.

"Recover %o for us, %p!  Only then will

"You are a heretic, %p!  How can you, %ra, deviate so from the

%sa to this order.  We will pray to %d for other assistance,
as you have failed us utterly."

"This is terrible, %p.  You have deviated from the true path!

you have purified yourself."

%Cc Pri 00016
"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
tell you of what has transpired:

"At one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, %n and a legion
of undead invaded %H.  Many %gP were killed, including
the one carrying %o.

"As a final act of vengefulness, %n desecrated the altar here.
Without it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
barely enough %gP left to keep the undead at bay.

"We need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
undead that befoul the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."

%Cp Pri 00024
"You may be able to affect %n with magical cold."
%E
%Cp Pri 00025
"Acquire and wear %o if you can.  It will aid you
against %n."
%E
%Cp Pri 00026
"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
%E
%Cp Pri 00027
"The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
%E
%Cp Pri 00028
"Do not loose faith, %p.  If you do so, %n will grow stronger."
%E
%Cp Pri 00029
"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the undead."
%E
%Cc Pri 00030
You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
%l.  It is ahead that you will find %ns trail.
%E
%Cp Pri 00031
Again, you stand before %i.
%E
%Cc Pri 00040
The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
of tortured souls assault your psyche.

Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
%E
%Cp Pri 00041
Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Pri 00050
"Ah, so %l has sent another %g to retrieve
%o.

after all.  Prepare to die, %r!  You shall never regain
%o."

"With %o, nothing can stand in my way."

As you pick up %o, you feel the essence of

easily defeat his plans.

You sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
get the impression that you must return to %l as soon
as possible.
%E
%Cc Pri 00080
You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %ns body dissolves
into a cloud of noxious gas.

Suddenly, a voice booms out:

    Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, %r.
    Know now that Moloch is aware of thy presence.
    As for thee, %n, I shall deal with thy failure
    at my leisure.

You then hear the voice of %n, screaming in terror...
%E
%Cc Pri 00081
"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
Congratulations.

"I have been in meditation, and have received direction from
a minion of %d.  %d commands that you retain
%o.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
of Yendor.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."

%Cp Pri 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"
%E

"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,

"A short time ago, the mountain centaurs to the east invaded
and enslaved the plains centaurs in this area.  The local
leader is now only a figurehead, and serves %n.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
hostile centaurs, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
headed by %n himself, managed to breach the grove and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
underground cavern of %n.  He has always coveted
%o, and will surely keep it.

"Recover %o for us, %p!  Only then will %d be safe."
%E
%Cp Ran 00020
"It is rumored that the Forest and Mountain Centaurs have resolved
their ancient feud and now band together against us."

to reach us."
%E
%Cp Ran 00023
"Remember, let %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Ran 00024
"Call upon %d when you face %n.
The very act of doing so will infuriate him, and give you advantage."
%E
%Cp Ran 00025
"%n and his kind have always hated us."
%E
%Cp Ran 00026
"We cannot hold the grove much longer, %p.  Hurry!"
%E
%Cp Ran 00027
"To infiltrate %i, you must be very stealthy."
%E
%Cp Ran 00028
"Remember that %n is a braggart.  Trust not what he says."
%E
%Cp Ran 00029
"You can triumph, %p, if you trust in %d."
%E
%Cc Ran 00030
This must be %i.

You are in a cave built of many different rooms, all interconnected
by tunnels.  Your quest is to find and shoot the evil wumpus that
resides elsewhere in the cave without running into any bottomless
pits or using up your limited supply of arrows.  Good luck.

You are in room 9 of the cave.  There are tunnels to rooms
5, 8, and 10.
*rustle* *rustle* (must be bats nearby)

%E
%Cc Ran 00040
You descend into a weird place, in which roughly cut cave-like walls
join with smooth, finished ones, as if someone was in the midst of
finishing off the construction of a subterranean complex.

Off in the distance, you hear a sound like the clattering of many
hooves on rock.

Once again, you enter the distorted castle of %n.

Your healing skills tell you that %ns wounds are mortal.

As you bow before %l, he welcomes you:

    You have brought your family great honor, %p-sama.

    While you have been gone the emperor's advisors have discovered in
    the ancient texts that the karma of the samurai who seeks to recover
    the amulet and the karma of %o are joined
    as the seasons join to make a year.

    Because you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests
    that you take leave of other obligations and continue on the
    road that fate has set your feet upon.  I would consider it
    an honor if you would allow me to watch your household until
    you return with the amulet.

With that, %l bows, and places his sword atop

However, things are not the same as when you were last here.  Mists and
