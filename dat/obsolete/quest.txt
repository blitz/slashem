You find yourself standing in sight of %H.  Something
is obviously wrong here.  The %H is badly damaged, walls
have been blasted apart and torn.

You realize that the %l needs your assistance!
%E
%Cp Dop 00002
Once again, you stand before %H.
%E
%Cp Dop 00003
Again you face %H.  Your intuition hints that this may be
the final time you come here.
%E
%Cp Dop 00005
"Greetings, honored %r.  It is good to see you."
%E
%Cp Dop 00006
"Ah, %p!  Surely you can help us in our hour of need."
%E
%Cp Dop 00007
"Greetings, %s.  %lC has great need of your help."
%E
%Cp Dop 00008
"Alas, it seems as if even %d has deserted us."
%E
%Cp Dop 00009
"May %d be with you, %s."
%E
%Cc Dop 00010
"Ah, %p, my %S.  You have returned to us at last.
A great blow has befallen our order; perhaps you can help us.
First, however, I must determine if you are prepared for this
great challenge."
%E
%Cp Dop 00011
"Again, my %S, you stand before me.  Are you ready now to help us?"
%E
%Cp Dop 00012
"Once more, %p, you stand before me.  Are you ready yet?"
%E
%Cc Dop 00013
"You have been corrupted, %p!  How can you, %ra, deviate so from the
teachings of %d?  Begone from this place!  You are no longer
%sa to this order.  We will try our best without you, as you have 
failed us utterly."
%E
%Cc Dop 00014
"Alas, %p, it is not yet to be.  A mere %r could never
withstand the might of %n.  Go forth, again into the world, and return
when you have attained the rank of %R."
%E
%Cc Dop 00015
"This is terrible, %p.  You have deviated from the way of balance!
You know that %d requires that we be impartial in the world around
us.  The %shood must stand for utmost piety.

"Go from here, atone for your sins against %d.  Return only when
you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Dop 00016
"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  I shall endevor to tell you
what has occurred while you were away."

"A short time ago we were beseiged by the Transmuter, a wizard  
of great power. We though nothing of it as we were well defended
and he would be no match for us because of our ability."

"However through the use of great magic he opened a portal into 
the room containing the %H and stole it.  With its power
he could easily see through our transformations.  He then summoned many 
chameleons, and we can not transform in fear of destroying members of 
our own clan. 

"We need you to find %i, and then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
creatures that roam the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."
%E
%Cp Dop 00020
"You can prevail, if you rely on %d."
%E
%Cp Dop 00021
"Remember that %n has great magic at his command."
%E
%Cp Dop 00022
"Be strong, my %S."
%E
%Cp Dop 00023
"Beware, %i is guarded by many Xorns and Chameleons."
%E
%Cp Dop 00024
"You may not be able to affect %n with magical spells."
%E
%Cp Dop 00025
"Acquire and wear %o if you can.  It will aid you
against your enemies."
%E
%Cp Dop 00026
"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
%E
%Cp Dop 00027
"The Xorns may pass through rock at will, beware of ambush!"
%E
%Cp Dop 00028
"Beware the lava, %p.  If you do not, you may be consumed."
%E
%Cp Dop 00029
"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the shapeshifters."
%E
%Cc Dop 00030
You have entered a cave that seems to have been drastically altered by magic.
There is smoke and fumes all around, yet the air seems moist and damp.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
%l.  It is ahead that you will find %ns trail.
%E
%Cp Dop 00031
Again, you stand before %i.
%E
%Cc Dop 00040
The black fumes and heat wash over you as you decend into this dark
place. Ahead, there is a clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
%E
%Cp Dop 00041
Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Dop 00050
"Ah, so %l has sent another %g to retrieve
%o.

"No, I see you are no %g.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
after all.  Prepare to die, %r!  You shall never regain
%o."
%E
%Cp Dop 00051
"So, %r.  Again you challenge me."
%E
%Cp Dop 00052
"Die now, %r.  You power is a mere speck compared to mine."
%E
%Cp Dop 00053
"You shall die, %r, and I will have %o back."
%E
%Cp Dop 00060
"Submit to my will, %c, and I shall spare you."
%E
%Cp Dop 00061
"Your puny powers are no match for me, %c."
%E
%Cp Dop 00062
"I shall have you turned into a newt for my pleasure!"
%E
%Cp Dop 00063
"Despair now, %r.  %d cannot help you."
%E
%Cp Dop 00064
"I shall feast upon your soul for many days, %c."
%E
%Cp Dop 00065
"Your death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!"
%E
%Cp Dop 00066
"You cannot defeat %n, you fool.  I shall kill you now."
%E
%Cp Dop 00067
"Your precious %l will be my next victim."
%E
%Cp Dop 00068
"I feel your powers failing you, %r.  You shall die now."
%E
%Cp Dop 00069
"With %o, nothing can stand in my way."
%E
%Cc Dop 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel as though a great
weight has been lifted from your shoulders. You understand 
why %n stole it from %H, for with it, 
%ca of %d could easily defeat his plans.

You sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
get the impression that you must return to %l as soon
as possible.
%E
%Cc Dop 00080
You hear %n gasp one last breath and collapse to the ground.

Suddenly, you hear a voice in the back of your mind,

    How could you have defeated me? I was so much 
    more powerful, I had %o and legions of   
    creatures at my command. You are certainly a force
    to be reckoned with ... I pity the Wizard of Yendor.

Then the voice of %n fades away, never to be heard again.
%E
%Cc Dop 00081
"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
Congratulations.

"I have been awaiting you return and have been thinking.  You
should take %o with you.  Use it to restore the balance of    
the world and serve %d.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."
%E
%Cp Dop 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"
%E
%Cc Dop 00091
"You have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,
you must take the amulet, and sacrifice it on %ds altar on
the Astral plane.  I suspect that I shall never see you again in this
life, but I hope to at %ds feet."

%Cc Dwa 00001
You find yourself on the familiar bank of the Long Lake, with the
buildings of Esgaroth visible nearby. %HC archers keep away
those monsters that manage to cross the water, but unfortunately the lands
outside are not so safe. Wolves howl on the wind! 

You steel yourself, and resolve to hurriedly cross the water and find out 
why you were summoned, and why %l is here, instead of in the Dwarven 
mines of Ered Luin?
%E
%Cp Dwa 00002
Once again you stand on the shores of the Long Lake.
%E
%Cp Dwa 00003
Yet again you stand on the shores of the Long Lake. Occasionally, you
notice red flashes to the north.
%E
%Cp Dwa 00005
"Avenge our forefathers for us, %p!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00006
"The King under the Mountain shall return and the rivers run with gold!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00007
"If you can do this, %p...perhaps? The Mansions of Khazad-Dum await.."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00008
"They say the wealth of the dragon is beyond counting."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00009
"The Blue are rich in iron, but my heart yearns for gold.."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00010
You instantly recognise %l from when you last saw him in the mines 
of Ered Luin. His descendancy from Durin the Deathless, and more recently 
Thror, King under the Mountain, is obvious. He bears himself with pride 
and hauteur, and his long, flowing beard is shock-white.

He stands, and visible at his side beneath the sky-blue hooded cloak is a 
sword, seemingly Elven in design, that looks to have a mighty lineage.

Pushing back his hood, he gives you a slow stare before speaking.

"The Wild can be a dangerous place to travel alone in these dark days, yet 
I see you have come far. But first I must ascertain how far..."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00011
"Ah, %p, you have returned.. Tell me of your more recent adventures.
What have you learnt? Have you grown more experienced in fighting?"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00012
"So, %p, again you stand before me. In the Wild the wargs and goblins
grow ever more restless, and %n stirs in the north. I know not how
much longer we can last. Are you yet ready?"
%E
%Cc Dwa 00013
"%p! You have failed? A thousand curses on you and yours! If you have
woken the Dragon but not killed him, we are surely doomed to perish in
dragon fire!

I would have you killed now, but you deserve not even that. Begone! And
if fortune looks kindly on you, know that no Dwarf will."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00014
"Ah, %p, it is foolish in the extreme to underestimate a dragon, and 
I cannot be sure you would succede. Go ye back into the Wild and hew ye 
some more orcs, and return when you are a %R."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00015
"Ah, alas, %p. The creatures of Morgoth have corrupted you in your
fight.

Dragons are cunning and intelligent, and any not pure of spirit will
surely be enslaved by their spells. I will heed the lesson of the Narn I
Hin Hurin, and send you not thither now.

Go back out, and return when you are better prepared."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00016
Yes, for better or ill, I deem you are ready. As you know, some 170 
years ago the accursed dragon %n descended on my grandfather's Kingdom 
in Erebor, killing many of my kin and driving us from our halls. I was 
there, although fortunately outside at the time..

This defeat weighs heavily on us, %p. I tell you there is no 
small store of gold in that mountain, and also %o, Heart of 
the Mountain. A more wondrous gem has not been seen since the first Age, 
and never in this part of the world.

I long to take up arms myself and attempt to defeat the dragon, yet I am 
nearing my 200th year, and I fear my skills are not as they were. I ask 
you, %p, to take up this quest for me. Succede in this, and your 
reward shall be what of the treasure you can carry out yourself!

Go, %p, and return victorious!
%E
%Cp Dwa 00020
"Be wary of his eyes! Dragons are mighty in enchantment!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00021
"There is a secret door on the east side!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00022
"My forefathers were mighty in metalsmithing..you may find equipment to 
aid you."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00023
"Beware the dragon's flame! You will need a defence against heat."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00024
"A dragon's scales make excellent armour. You will need a mighty weapon!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00025
"Some dragons have soft undersides. But %n has an armour of gold and
gems!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00026
"Dragons have excellent hearing and smell, and do not need to see you."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00027
"Kill %n, and you avenge your murdered forefathers!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00028
"Erebor and Dale were famed throughout the north. It can be so again!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00029
"Beware not only the jaws and flame, but also the tail and claws."
%E
%Cc Dwa 00030
You have followed the River Running to its source at the Front
Gate. Here is the entrance to %i.To the east
you can just make out the ruins of Dale.

Steam drifts out the gateway, and in some places the water bubbles...The 
Dragon is obviously in.

The wind howls through the tree--wind? The Wargs are come! And orcs with 
them! The goblins from the mountains must have got wind of something..
%E
%Cp Dwa 00031
Once again you stand at the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Dwa 00040
As you near the Great Hall of Thrain, the dragon-stench increases to
almost unbearable levels. Only the reknowned stamina and willpower of the
dwarves allows you to continue. Occasionally, you hear a near-by rumble or
hissing sound as %n exhales.
%E
%Cp Dwa 00041
The mountain rumbles with the dragon's fury. %n was not pleased with 
your escape, and won't want to let you go this time..
%E
%Cc Dwa 00050
"Well, %p, good of you to come..I haven't tasted Dwarf in a while. 
Chomped a few when I moved in, though."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00051
"Watch those whiskers, stumpy, I might singe them off.."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00052
"Intelligence is a survival trait. It'll be a favour to weed you out.."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00053
"I'll have the %o back before long. You're not leaving with it, I
guarantee that."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00060
"So they gave up on burglars? A pity, I liked the taste of hobbit."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00061
"Go back to your mines, long-beard, before I roast you!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00062
"You fight well for a dwarf, but no mortal ever defeated a dragon!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00063
"Your best could not kill me when I came, and I am grown now far stronger!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00064
"That is a fine weapon you have - it shall look well in my collection!"
%E
%Cp Dwa 00065
"Your prancing amuses me. I may even let you live.."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00066
"You have courage, Dwarf. Fortunately, you will still taste good."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00067
"You act as if you had a chance.. But 'tis true, only a fool would have come."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00068
"A curse on the armour of Dwarves.. I fear I shall need a tin-opener."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00069
"You show some small skill.. but can you stand the heat?"
%E
%Cc Dwa 00070
%oC shines as you pick it up, it's white light red through your
skin. And you feel it could perhaps do more, if you knew how to unlock
its secrets..

It is clear now why %l valued the jewel so highly. You resolve to 
return it to him, even though it is rightfully yours as bounty.
%E
%Cc Dwa 00080
As you deal a final blow to %n's battered body, the dragon rears its 
head up into the air on its last strength, and cries out:

"No! I cannot believe it!" He swings his head around to stare at you 
again - "YOU? It can't be!"

With that, the mighty dragon crashes to the floor. You make your way 
around to his head, carefully avoiding the blood already etching 
interesting patterns into the stone floor, and deliver a mighty blow to 
the neck. The whole body jerks and you leap backwards out of the way in 
time to hear a hiss of breath escape from between the teeth. Never trust a 
dragon, you smile to yourself. It must surely be dead now, with a large 
gash in its neck, but to be sure you deliver a few more blows and take 
the head off completely. Only then do you turn to examine the hoard.
%E
%Cc Dwa 00081
"%p! Rumours have been rife that the %n has fallen, and I see it 
must be so! We will reoccupy the Mountain forthwith..

You have the %o? Ah, but it does good to see this.. Yet last 
night Aule appeared to be in a dream - it seems the %o is to be 
taken by you on your quest. It will be a victory in itself when its light 
shines out in Moloch's lair! 

I would that you had 50 of our best to aid you, but we will need them all 
in days to come, I fear. So you must make do with my blessing.

May your beard grow longer and your axe never dull."
%E
%Cp Dwa 00090
"Ah, %p! How goes your quest for the Amulet?"
%E
%Cc Dwa 00091
"The Amulet of Yendor.." %l raises the profferred amulet and looks 
at it, before handing it back. "Yes, I can see why Moloch would want it, 
and why Aule would send you to retrieve it for us.. but your quest is not 
yet over, %p.

Hence must you journey to the dungeon entrance and out, and with the 
Amulet you will be sent by the Gods into the Elemental Planes, areas of 
great danger and strangeness. The Amulet itself may help you find your 
way through them.

Survive this and you will find yourself in the Astral Plane. You must go 
to the temple of %d and offer up the Amulet. Good luck."

And they've noticed you!
%E
%Cp Elf 00002
Once again, you stand before %H.

%Cp Elf 00012
"Ah, you are here again, %p.  Allow me to determine your readiness..."
%E
%Cc Elf 00013

"Begone!  We renounce your %shood with us!  You are an outcast now!"
%E
%Cc Elf 00014
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to withstand the demands of that

%Cc Elf 00016
"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,
and why we so desperately need your help:

"A short time ago, the Uruk-hai tribes of the mountains to the east
invaded and enslaved the goblin tribes in this area.  The local
%nt is now only a figurehead, and serves the Uruk-hai Overlord.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
orcs and goblins, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
headed by %n himself, managed to breach the circle and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
underground castle of %n.  He has always coveted
%o, and will surely keep it on his person,
until he delivers it to the Uruk-hai Overlord.

"Recover %o for us, %p!  Only then will
the circle of %d be safe."
%E
%Cp Elf 00020
"It is rumored that the Uruk-hai have a pact with the Hill Ogres."

to reach us."
%E
%Cp Elf 00023
"Remember, let %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Elf 00024
"Call upon %d when you face %n.
The very act of doing so will infuriate him, and give you advantage."
%E
%Cp Elf 00025
"Though %n is as %C as we, he and his kind have always
hated us."
%E
%Cp Elf 00026
"We cannot hold the circle much longer, %p.  Hurry!"
%E

"To infiltrate %i, you must be very stealthy."

"You can triumph, %p, if you trust in %d."

%Cp Elf 00031
Once again, you descend into %i.
%E
%Cc Elf 00040
You descend into a weird place, in which roughly cut cave-like walls
join with smooth, finished ones, as if someone was in the midst of

%nC falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then he
slowly slumps over in a pool of his own blood and dies!

When %l sees %o, he grins, and says:

    Well done, %p.  You have saved our race from certain genocide!
    What, now, should be done with %o?

    My people are weak... that has been proven. Our only hope is that
    you retrieve The Amulet and make %d head of the gods!

    Take %o with you, %p. It will help you destroy 
    all who stand in you path.
    
    Remember me, %p, and return when you have triumphed.  I
    will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
    time comes.

%Cc Lyc 00091
"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly
succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
of Yendor!

"Return to the dungeon and make you way to the surface. When you
reach the Astral Plane sacrifice it on %ds altar.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."
